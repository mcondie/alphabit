Developers hear this all the time. “I’ve got this idea for an app, and I just need someone to develop it." If the would be entrepreneur is particularly naive they will follow this with something like “I’d be willing to give you (insert any percentage less than 100%) of the profits if you were willing to develop it." 

This isn’t another post about how ideas are cheap, and it’s only developers who create real value in technology companies/startups. There is a lot of value in ideas, but not without putting in a great deal of work to support them. 

I have been pitched several times to be the technical cofounder of a startup, and I often hear, usually after I decline the offer, that it is very hard to find any developers willing to work on new ventures. This is not actually true, developers will jump at the chance to work (even without pay at first) on a concept that they truly believe in. The real work in being the “idea person" for a startup is making it low risk for a developer to believe in your idea. 

The first step to convincing developers is to find a real customer. Find someone who is actually willing to pay money for the thing you want to build. (Note, this means that you will never find a developer to build your new social network. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and every other bootstrapped social network were initially designed and built by developers, without any idea people involved. Developers are only dumb enough to work that hard without making money if it is their own idea.) Ideally you will actually get the credit card numbers of several hundred people, ready to be billed as soon as the product is finished. 

Step two, now that you have realized that no one wants to buy the app you initially had in mind, or at least not at the price you want to charge, it’s time to start doing some market research. Find a way to make a list of 100 potential customers that you can actually talk to on the phone. Now call them and ask them about the problems they have in their business/life. Write down what they say, and try to find common themes and scenarios. Now take this research to a developer that you want to work with and together develop an app idea that solves the real problems that people have. 

Repeat steps one and two until you have enough guaranteed customers that you and your developer don’t mind working for a few months without pay knowing that revenue is assured. 

If this sounds like a lot of work, it is. Being the idea person for a startup is a lot more work than being a technical cofounder. If you haven’t already demonstrated the ability and willingness to do the customer development work necessary, then it would be stupid for a developer to invest tens of thousands of dollars of their own time in your idea.
