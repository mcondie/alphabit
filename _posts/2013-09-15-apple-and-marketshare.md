#Apple, Margins, and Marketshare

In all of the chatter this last week about the IPhone 5C/S announcement, a lot of tech pundits have been second guessing Apple's lack of a truly low end phone for "emerging" markets. They don't seem to understand Apple's approach to every market category they compete in. Apple only makes premium products with high margins. The Macbook Air, Apple's "low cost" laptop is at minimum $999, while you can bring a Dell, or other mass market laptop home for less that $400. I'm fairly certain that Apple has no interest in competing in the middle to low end of the cell phone, or any other market, where they are competing against essentially collections of cheap components with barely functional drivers, the exact opposite of an Apple product. 
Apple's plans for growth seem to have very little to do with expanding their marketshare in their existing product categories, and everything to do with creating or entering new categories. Their stock price reflects the uncertainty of this growth strategy, although it will be ready to surge upward again if Apple introduces the next new big thing.
