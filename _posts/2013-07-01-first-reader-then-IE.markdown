Google is shutting down Reader next week, and this made me think, why is Microsoft still making a browser? 

Google is shutting Reader down because they don’t make any (or at least enough) money, because it costs them money to maintain it, and it doesn’t give them any other strategic advantage. I’m sure there are other reasons as well, but the move is entirely justified by those reasons. 

Microsoft should kill internet explorer for the same reasons. I realize that Windows is a huge money maker, and Internet Explorer is technically part of Windows. But has anyone ever bought a copy of Windows because they really wanted to use IE? 

IE has never really created any strategic advantage for Microsoft. Sure, it did a great job of killing off Netscape back in the day, but that company wasn’t a real threat to Microsoft in the first place. 

What is the real purpose of IE? It makes no money, it makes developers hate Microsoft, it makes the web experience for Microsoft’s customers worse. 

Microsoft has repeatedly shown a willingness to throw money at software just for the sake of being in every software category. Google used to do that too, but they have started to wise up. Maybe it’s time for Microsoft to do the same. Make developers everywhere (and your shareholders) very happy and just get rid of IE. (or at least auto update everyone to the latest version)
