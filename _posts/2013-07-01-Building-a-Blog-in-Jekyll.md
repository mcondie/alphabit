The site that you are currently reading was created using Jekyll and hosted on Heroku. I did this rather than use a traditional CMS primarily because I am a hacker at heart, and I can. Also, I am completely performance obsessed and the idea of a completely flat file website makes me smile. Jekyll lets me tinker with lots of different technologies that a traditional CMS like wordpress doesn't.
