"... Punchy fusions of text and image..."

"70 gorgeous film inspired looks..."

"A minimal and beautiful app..."

I get it. You built a pretty app. Congratulations, your app doesn't look like it was styled by a third year CS student who just discovered UI Kit. Great job.

Now please stop.

There are enough pretty apps in the app store now. What I want are well designed apps. 

I blame Apple for perpetuating the myth that style and design are synonymous when it comes to apps. The top apps of 2013, and the editor's selections on the app store front page are littered with "gorgeous" and "stunning" creations, pixel perfect executions of inanimate psds. 

Good luck living in that perfectly painted house with no running water. 

Look at some of the most iconic apps in the app store. Instapaper made reading a beautiful experience, however it also had the infrastructure to collect and parse millions of web pages. Foursquare was always a minimalist design, but it was merely the tip of a giant application that could connect people in real time. Instagram was not just a filter app, but a platform for distributing photos instantaneously. 

IOS is a great language for building user interfaces, but if your application is entirely user interface, it probably isn't very well designed.
