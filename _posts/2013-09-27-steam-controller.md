Steam today announced a [bespoke controller](http://store.steampowered.com/livingroom/SteamController/) for their upcoming Steam OS game console operating system. 

The controller looks interesting from a pure hardware nerd perspective. They claim it has a resolution approaching that of a desktop mouse. My biggest complaint about console gaming is that I feel like game controllers are carnival hammers compared to the surgeon's scalpel of the mouse and keyboard. Microsoft will [back me up on that too](http://kotaku.com/5593259/rumor-microsoft-killed-plans-for-pc-vs-xbox-360-online-play). I'm skeptical of Steam's claims, but I can't wait to try it anyway.
